## Introduction

Forecasting models play a crucial role in various domains, including climate science. In this project, we explore the implementation of RNNs, specifically SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), for temperature forecasting using time series data.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand and preprocess time series data
- Implement different types of Recurrent Neural Networks - SimpleRNN, LSTM, GRU
- Build and train RNNs for temperature forecasting
- Gain insights into advanced RNN concepts such as recurrent dropout, stacking recurrent layers, and Bi-directional RNNs

## Usage

### Running the Notebook Locally

To run the notebook locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Build-a-Forecasting-Model-using-RNN.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```
    cd Build-a-Forecasting-Model-using-RNN
    ```

3. Open the notebook file `Build_a_Forecasting_Model_using_RNN.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Execute the notebook cells one by one to understand the time series data, implement different RNN architectures, and build the forecasting model.

### Running the Notebook on Google Colab

You can also run the notebook directly in your browser using Google Colab. Click the "Open in Colab" badge above, and it will open the notebook in Colab. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and build the forecasting model.
